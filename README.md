# Breath of the Wild Enemy Randomizer v2 by Echocolat 

_Big thanks to ArchLeaders for his help and MintLightning for cleaning up the scripts, some help with tweaking, and the arrangement into one file._

### What do you need:
1. BCML (latest)
2. Python 3.8+ after installing the module oead (pip install oead)
3. A legally obtained copy of Breath of the Wild v1.5.0 with DLC

### How to use:
1. Launch Enemy_Randomizer.py and select your options. 
2. If you want the enemies to not respawn each time you load a save:
   - Copy `WhereYourUpdateBotWIs\content\Pack\Bootup.pack` and paste it inside `Enemized\content\Pack`.
   - Install the package `botw_flag_util`, and use the command:
     - `botw_flag_util generate [path to the mod's root] -r 1 1 -b` in the `Enemized` folder.
3. Use BCML to install the rules.txt file inside the folder "Enemy Randomizer v2".
4. Activate the mod (if you're using Chaos mode, it is strongly recommanded to use the Extended Memory community graphic pack) and enjoy!!!
